# ReproNim ReproFlow Data Analysis


Algorithm proposals for the ReproFlow time synchronization effort:
- Parse videos with QR codes from session `reprostim-videos` folder with `reprostim/Parse/parse_wQR.py` tool and place results under `timing-reprostim-video` location. At this moment it's unclear how to merge or split this data. So as initial step we consider single video file containing all QR codes. The tool takes long time to proceed video, so we cached result manually in `timing-reprostim-videos` folder for prorotype/development purposes.
  - `./parse_wQR.py --log-level DEBUG /data/repronim/reproflow-data-sync/ses-20240604/reprostim-videos/2024.06.04.13.51.36.620_2024.06.04.13.58.20.763.mkv > 2024.06.04.13.51.36.620_2024.06.04.13.58.20.763.qrinfo.jsonl 2> 2024.06.04.13.51.36.620_2024.06.04.13.58.20.763.qrinfo.log`
- Parse DICOMs with `code/dump_dicoms.py` tool. It produces JSONL file with timing data, image data, sessions data and study data.
  - `./dump_dicoms.py --log-level DEBUG /data/repronim/reproflow-data-sync/ses-20240604 >dump_dicoms.jsonl 2> dump_dicoms.log` 
- Prepare merged JSONL data for psychopy logs. It should be filtered by QR codes and DICOMs information.
  - Proposal for filtering are:
    - Extract JSON records from DICOMs log with type=study, name=dbic^QA, and extract general time range in MRI scanner format. In future we need to concentrate on series started with `func-` prefix, because it produced necessary event/pulse/message in system. Study time range can be set as 60 minutes before study.isotime_start and 60 minutes after study.isotime_end.
    - Extract names of psychopy logs from QR codes log available via QrRecord.data.logfn e.g. 20240604_run-3.log, and use only this filed to parse.
    - From this log subset filter only records with iso_time field in range of MRI study with overlap we calculated above.
    - Filter record with "alink_byte": 496, "alink_flags": 3.
