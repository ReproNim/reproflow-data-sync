- could not find existing psychopy venv/conda env which works. Creating new...

now it is psychopy-2024.2.1 in ~/miniconda3

- meanwhile tried sound

  - could not make it work through HDMI/audio jack on HDMI -> VGA+audio
  - switched to play through built-in socket on laptop. Recorded sample

    2024.10.04-09.04.39.304--2024.10.04-09.05.24.132.mkv -- and probably much longer prior one -- has sound!

  so we should be ok with sound

- chatted with chatgpt 

  - chatgpt-psychopy-1.py -- basic to get things going
  - chatgpt-pydub-1.py -- some with pydub
  - chatgpt-dtmf-1.py is kinda close to what needed
 
- committed changes which should have produced some sound but none came out TODO

- TODO: copy data!
