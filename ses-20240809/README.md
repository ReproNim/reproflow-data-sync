## 20240809

### Summary

- Earlier short runs are no good
- Useful bugs unraveled in the process
- Reported time difference from DICOMs to Terry and he relayed to Siemens tech who promised to "manually sync" the time on the scanner that day during the maintenance.

### 20240809_acq-short1_run-01.log -- important finding by mistake

- I forgot to connect usb for trigger pulse to my laptop.  
- As a result stimuli did not present any qrcode (although I thought there was a flip) and only at the end when I pressed 'q'.
- But also what was odd is that on birch the .json file also did not get any trigger pulse logged
- IS BIRCH LOGGING WHEN USB IS DISCONNECTED? DONE: emailed Ben of curdes about this.
- but we did them collected using our micropython board -- so they were at TTL level!
- I then connected usb cable leading to birch.

### 20240809_acq-short1_run-02.log -- "mistake" again

- I did not switch focus to psychopy window (apparently important but actually is not generally -- must be my laptop bisbehaving), so trigger pulses sent as '5's were not picked up by psychopy.
- But THEY WERE SENT overall over usb - so people would not know that birch did not record!
- The birch did not record any trigger pulse.

- And it did not record any trigger pulse or "live heartbeat" since Aug 02nd!
very odd.  It is set to trackball. last log lines (show also today I redid output mode so it is overall alive)

### 20240809_acq-short1_run-03.log 

- We switched to another mode for trackball -- HID_MOUSE_1 and that did not record anything too.
- My laptop also started to misbehave with those "random" events sent by X and started to scroll terminal. my touchscreen was disabled already before sleep. 
- Selecting in terminal for the clipboard stopped working!
- I ctrl-C'ed the  psychopy script
- Terry connected 2x2 button thingie, but birch in Autodetect said it was 1x1 !
- Terry rebooted the birch!
- Birch correctly selected 2x2...

  only then we unplug/plug USB, did reselect of device and the output mode 

### 20240809_acq-short1_run-04.log 

This one finally worked out ok and birch and everything seems has recorded stuff... NOT THE VIDEO GRAB!!!

main log only has from a few minutes back that it killed the ffmpeg:

    Killed

and we scanned at 10:25 or so....  when I unplugged video we got

so unclear why it stopped recording before!

### 20240809_acq-short1_run-05.log  -- first success!

I think all went well.  There was first fast QR code flashing on the screen really fast... check what it is!

### 20240809_acq-short1_run-06.log  -- 2nd success!

### 20240809_acq-short1_run-07.log  -- 3nd success!
### 20240809_acq-med1_run-01.log  -- screw ups!

   - stimuli script stopped by itself after only few dynamics:

   I fixed up script to do up to 300 dynamics.

   TODO: make it smart!

- we did few more med1 runs.  I lost connection to birch and reproiner -- smaug seems to be down!
