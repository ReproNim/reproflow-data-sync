- It was ran from Yarik's laptop, not reproiner.  Failed to install psychopy in a virtualenv on reproiner -- might need wx etc libraries
- Laptop clock is not entirely in sync :-/

so over 600ms off. I am installing ntpsec now

- There should be two last runs of data and logs and videos

 We did restart the psychopy script  a few times though
